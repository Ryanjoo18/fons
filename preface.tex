\chapter*{Preface}
\emph{Fons}, derived from the Latin word for source or fountain, introduces the core concepts of university-level mathematics. Just as a fountain provides a continuous wellspring of water, \emph{Fons} aims to be a continuous source of knowledge for you.

At this moment of writing, I am a high school student working on my A Level studies in Singapore. I have about 11 years of participating in mathematics competitions, including three years of experience in mental arithmetic and the rest few years in mathematics olympiad.

This book mainly serves as my notes when studying mathematics at the university level. Feel free to refer to it too.
