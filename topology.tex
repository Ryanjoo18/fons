\begin{enumerate}
\item An arbitrary union of open sets is open; a finite intersection of open sets is open.

\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be an arbitrary union of open sets $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$.

Then for any $x \in A$, suppose that $x \in U_i$, then since $U_i$ is open we can pick $B(x,\epsilon)$ subset of $U_i$ subset of $A$

On the other hand, let $U$ and $V$ be open sets and let $x \in U \cap V$. 
Since $U$ and $V$ are open, we can pick $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ such that $B(x,\epsilon_1)$ is in $U$ whereas $B(x,\epsilon_2)$ is in $V$. 
Then we simply pick $\epsilon=\min\{\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2\}$ so that $B(x,\epsilon)$ is in $U \cap V$.
\end{proof}

\item An arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed; a finite union of closed sets is closed.

\begin{proof}
This follows from de Morgan's Law on P1 and P2.
