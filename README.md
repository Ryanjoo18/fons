# Fons: A University Mathematics Source

Welcome to Fons! (Latin for "source" or "fountain")

This book is a collection of notes on core university-level mathematics concepts, designed to be a continuous wellspring of knowledge for your studies.  Just as a fountain provides a constant flow of water, Fons aims to be a reliable source to quench your thirst for mathematical understanding.

## Author's Background

I am currently a high school student in Singapore pursuing my A Levels. My passion for mathematics extends over 11 years, with experiences in both mental arithmetic competitions (3 years) and the Mathematics Olympiad (remaining years).

## Purpose of this Book

While primarily serving as my personal notes for university-level mathematics, I am happy to share this resource with anyone interested in exploring these concepts. Feel free to use this book as a supplementary study guide alongside your main textbook or lectures.

## What to Expect

This book will delve into fundamental university mathematics topics, explained in a clear and concise manner. The focus will be on building a strong foundation for further mathematical exploration.

## Contents

The book mainly contains the following sections:

- preliminary topics such as basic logic and set theory,
- abstract algebra,
- linear algebra,
- real analysis,
- complex analysis, and
- topology.

## Please Note

As this book is based on my current understanding and may not be a comprehensive resource, it's recommended to use it in conjunction with other established textbooks and course materials.

I hope you find Fons to be a valuable companion on your journey through the fascinating world of university mathematics!
